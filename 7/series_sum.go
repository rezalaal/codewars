#Sum of the first nth term of Series

Task
Your task is to write a function which returns the n-th term of the following series, which is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence (n is the input parameter).

Series:1+1/4+1/7+1/10+1/13+1/16+â€¦


You will need to figure out the rule of the series to complete this.

Rules
You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

If the given value is 0 then it should return "0.00".

You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

Examples (Input --> Output)
n
1 --> 1 --> "1.00"
2 --> 1 + 1/4 --> "1.25"
5 --> 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 --> "1.57"

	var sum float64 = 0

        sum += 1.0 / float64(3*i + 1)
    }
    return fmt.Sprintf("%.2f", sum)
