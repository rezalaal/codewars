#Leap Years

In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, 
here they are:

Years divisible by 4 are leap years,
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years,
but years divisible by 400 are leap years.
Tested years are in range 1600 â‰¤ year â‰¤ 4000.

		if year%100 == 0 {
			if year%400 == 0 {
				return true
			}

		return true
	}
	return false
}

	return year%400 == 0 || year%100 != 0 && year%4 == 0
